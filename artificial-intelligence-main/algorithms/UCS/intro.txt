# Uniform-Cost Search (Dijkstra for large Graphs)

Uniform-Cost Search is a variant of Dijikstraâ€™s algorithm. Here, instead of inserting all vertices into 
a priority queue, we insert only the source, then one by one insert when needed. In every step, we check 
if the item is already in the priority queue (using the visited array). If yes, we perform the decrease key, 
else we insert it.

This variant of Dijkstra is useful for infinite graphs and that graph which are too large to represent in 
memory. Uniform-Cost Search is mainly used in Artificial Intelligence.
